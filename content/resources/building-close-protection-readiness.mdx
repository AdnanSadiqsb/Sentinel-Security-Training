## Start with outcomes

Close protection training is most effective when learners know the expected standard. Define outcomes first, such as safe route planning, advance work, and professional conduct.

## Structure assessments in stages

Use short, realistic stages rather than a single long assessment. Early stages can test communication and observation. Later stages should replicate operational pressure without unnecessary complexity.

## Make expectations explicit

Explain assessment criteria before each stage. Learners perform better when they understand what is being measured and how evidence is recorded.

## Use short debriefs

Brief debriefs after each exercise allow learners to correct mistakes quickly and build confidence.
