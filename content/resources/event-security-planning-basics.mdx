## Begin with a risk map

Every event should start with a simple risk map. Identify crowd flow, entry points, emergency access, and high-density areas.

## Build a clear briefing

Briefings should cover entry control, escalation routes, and communication channels. Keep the format consistent so teams know what to expect.

## Maintain steady communication

Consistent check-ins reduce confusion on the day. Use clear handover points and an agreed escalation process.

## Review and refine

Post-event reviews should capture incidents, near misses, and improvement actions so future delivery remains calm and controlled.
